I have a passion for coding and robotics. I love creating games using Pygame, scratch and creating robots. I know languages like Python, Javascript, HTML and AHK. I'm currently working on my chatbot program and my website, which is updating almost daily on my Github page. I’m currently learning C++ and how to use VEX Robotics.
