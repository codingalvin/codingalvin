I have a passion for coding and robotics. I love creating games using Pygame, scratch and creating robots. I know languages like Python, Javascript, HTML and AHK. I'm currently working on my chatbot program and my website, which is updating almost daily on my Github page. I’m currently learning C++ and how to use VEX Robotics.

###Here are some of my creations that I have put online:

[Alvin's Website](https://codingalvin.github.io)
I made this website via HTML and CSS code. Still trying to add more functionality.

[The North York Times](https://sites.google.com/view/thenorthyorktimes)
I made this website using Google Sites and it is used to take a look at news for Canada and the GTA or the Greater Toronto Area. Here I used RSS feeds to grab news from diffrent news plaforms like Toronto Star, Toronto Sun, Citynews, etc.
